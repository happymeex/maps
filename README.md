# Virtual Tour
This source code produces two slideshows, one for each facility operated by [Opportunities For Inclusion](https://www.oppsforinclusion.org/). Each slideshow has a clickable button that brings up a floor plan of the corresponding facility, which users can explore by hovering over certain rooms.

Adding images to the slideshows and buttons to the floor plans is fairly intuitive: navigate to `slideshow.js` and `popup.js`, respectively, and add an entry to the `photos` or `data` variable, respectively, in the same format as the existing entries.
